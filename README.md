# MyCredits Solidity Contract

## Description

he MyCredits Solidity contract presents a straightforward Ethereum smart contract responsible for overseeing a fundamental token system. It enables users to generate fresh tokens, eliminate existing ones, and offers insights into the overall token supply. This contract serves as a starting point for constructing intricate token systems or for educational endeavors.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program
To deploy and interact with the MyCredits contract, follow the steps below:

1. Deployment Environment: Use an Ethereum development environment or an online Solidity IDE like Remix.
2. Contract Deployment:
* Create a new Solidity file and name it
  ```
  My.Credit.sol
  ```
* Copy and paste the provided contract code into the file.
* Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler compatible with version ^0.8.0.
* Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice.

3. Interacting with the Contract
   * Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using its functions:
     The ```mint``` function facilitates the generation of fresh tokens by augmenting both the overall supply and the balance linked to a specified address.
   * The ```burn``` function empowers users to eliminate current tokens by reducing both the overall supply and the balance attributed to a specified address.
